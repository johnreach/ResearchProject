Here's the quick deal on the log parsers.

These essentially parse a svn or cvs log file and insert
information into a database.  To run, you need three things:

 * the project name (this can be anything, but make it consistent with what you
 use for other tools)

 * a log file.  
   To get an svn log file do:
   svn log --xml -v > foo.log
   To get a cvs log file do:
   cvs log > bar.log

 * a jdbc url for the database you are using.  Heres an example:
   jdbc:mysql://chimp.cs.ubc.ca/generics?user=cabird&password=foobar

   remember that on the command line in bash, ampersands need to be escaped (i.e. \&)

Then you pass these as arguments to the java in that order.  Note that the
parser to use depends on whether it is a cvs or an svn log file, but the
database schema is the same for both (that's why the revision "column" is a
string and not an int).

Note that the postgres and mysql database driver jars are baked into the
logparser.jar file by ant so that's all you need to have on your classpath.
You don't need to add any jdbc jars.

Here's a simple invocation example

java -classpath build/lib/logparsers.jar edu.ucdavis.cssr.logparsers.RevisionSVNLogParser 
    jedit jedit.xml.log jdbc:mysql://chimp.cs.ubc.ca/generics?user=cabird\&password=foobar
